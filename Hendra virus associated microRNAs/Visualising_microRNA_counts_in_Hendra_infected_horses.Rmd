# Introduction
Hi my name is Marina. I work on viruses. Before data school I would typically enter my data into Excel or Prism to make bar graphs with errors bars, then communicate these in publications and powerpoint slides. Using R, I can now reproducibly wrangle data imported from Excel, plot with ggplot2 to make really flexible and informative visualisations of the raw data. This has helped me to understand the sources of variation in my data, apply appropriate statistics and make novel visualisations.  

# My Project
My group are looking to find microRNAs that are predictive of viral infection. Such microRNAs could act as early bio-markers of infection. Allowing us to isolate the infected individual before they show signs of infection.  To identify these microRNAs we set up an experiment in which three horses were infected with Hendra virus and blood was taken at day 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7. RNA was extracted and sequenced, many millions of sequencing reads were then aligned to the 800+ currently defined microRNAs in the horse genome. This process generates a table where the number of aligned reads for each microRNA are counted for each sample. My goal was to model a relationship between microRNA expression level and time since infection using multi-linear regression.

I began with two tables, one a count matrix for each microRNA and the other a table containing metadata.

Just be looking at these tables, there are some challenging apsects to this data.

* 800+ microRNAs

* microRNAs with zero counts

* Sample 6 did not work

## Data clean up
Plotting the total counts for each sample or library (Figure 1) we see that they vary considerably around the mean for this experiment, `r mean(lib_size$counts_sum)`million counts shown by the red dashed line. To conduct a filtering step we'll need to normalise counts by library size so that sample 11 for example doesn't loose too many microRNAs because the library wasn't as high yeilding as the others. 
```{r plotting library size, out.width = '50%', fig.align = 'left'}

```

We can convert the raw counts to counts per million (CPM) using the edgeR package after removing sample 6. Then we filter the lowly expressed microRNAs, leaving 
`r nrow(horse_counts$genes)` from the original `r nrow(horse_filtered$genes)`. 


**Tables**
I wanted to perform PCA on these samples to identify samples with similar expression profiles. Do the horses differ significantly?
